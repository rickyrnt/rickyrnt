# Hello My Name Is Eric Yarnot
But you can call me Rick Yrnt if you want to save yourself a few syllables!

## Who Are You

I am a freshman at Case Western Reserve University studying Engineering Physics with a concentration in Computer Engineering. 
I am also interested in game development, audio development, and music.

## Ok What Do You Know About Coding

In the past I have used Java, C#, and C++ for projects, and am currently learning to use Python and C!

## And What Projects Have You Done

I was programming lead for my high school FRC robotics team, and am a current member of CWRUbotix.
I also participated in the 2022 Qiskit Fall Fest, helping to create a 
[quantum solution to finding G-Code paths for laser cutters](https://github.com/rpitasky/qiskit-gcode-path-optimization).

My personal projects include [this music vizualiser](https://youtu.be/Lm6FAdxGNP4) for a song I wrote.
The vizualiser was written in C++ utilizing OpenFrameworks to process MIDI and audio data.

I am currently coding VST audio processing plugins Morsalyzer and Morsinator, which are intended to
streamline using morse code in music production!
